Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project we were to develop an object-oriented programming application that displayed two clocks to clients. One clock being a standard 12 hour clock and the other clock being a 24 hour clock. 
What did you do particularly well?
With this I project I feel that the functionality and display of the clocks went great.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I do feel my code could have been more interactive and the display could have been cleaner. I would like to go back to the display to arrange the clocks a bit differently for a better user experience.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What I found ch allenging was converting seconds to minutes after increments reached 60 and properly displaying am or pm on the clocks as the time changed. For this I mostly used class resources along with stack overflow to gather different ideas until I found something I was comfortable with. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
With this project I gained insight about displaying menus and gathering user input. These both will help with other projects moving forward. This project also helped with reading a flow chart and identifying user requests. These also will apply to most of the work I'll do moving forward.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
For this program I feel the comments that I left made the program readable and understandable for anyone who followed me. I also believe the code could be easily maintained and added to because of the simplistic style.
